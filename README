POE-Component-IRC-Plugin-AntiSpamMailTo

This module is a small L<POE::Component::IRC> plugin which uses
L<POE::Component::IRC::Plugin> for its base. It provides interface to
generate C<< <a href="mailto:foo@bar">... >> links that escape every single characters
preventing dumb spam bots from harvesting the email addresses. I did not do any actual research
on how useful this technique actually is but people who employ it say that it's effective
as long as you encode the C<mailto:> part as well.
The plugin accepts input from public channel events, C</notice> messages as well
as C</msg> (private messages); although that can be configured at will.
